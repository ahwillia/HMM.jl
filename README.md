# HMM.jl
A module for fitting Hidden Markov Models in Julia

This is just a side-project for me at the moment. It needs a lot more development and love to be useful for modeling applications. [Get in touch with me](http://alexhwilliams.info) if you have comments/suggestions or words of encouragement.

In the meantime check out [ToyHMM.jl](https://github.com/ahwillia/ToyHMM.jl), for a simple implementation of a discrete HMM in Julia.
